Central Limit Theorem Visualizations

This Rshiny WebApp is made to visualize the central limit theorem for different distributions through simulations. To access this shiny app, go to [This link](https://9bw6-devstat.shinyapps.io/CLT_viz/) and have fun! 

The central limit theorem says that whenever a sample of sufficiently large size is drawn from any population having a finite mean and a variance, the sample mean will approximately follow a normal distribution. But is this true for any distribution with a finite mean and variance? Let's find out with this shiny app!
